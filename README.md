[![Forex Robot Easy](https://forexroboteasy.com)](https://forexroboteasy.com/forex-robot-review/nas100-auto-sl-tp-maker-review-seamless-forex-trading-on-mt4/)

This trading robot is designed to automate the management of StopLoss and TakeProfit levels for traders operating on the Nasdaq 100 market via the MetaTrader 4 platform. It dynamically adjusts the levels based on user-configured settings to minimize the risk of oversight in dynamic market conditions. It supports both market and pending orders and is compatible with the MetaTrader 4 platform.

## How It Works

The robot is implemented as an Expert Advisor (EA) in the MetaTrader 4 platform. It consists of several functions that are executed at different stages of the trading process.

### Expert Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called when the EA is first loaded onto a chart. It is used to perform any necessary initialization tasks.

### Expert Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the EA is removed from a chart. It is used to perform any necessary clean-up tasks.

### Expert Start Function

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick of the market. It is responsible for monitoring trades without StopLoss and/or TakeProfit levels, adjusting the levels dynamically based on user-configured settings, and ensuring seamless automation of StopLoss and TakeProfit management.

### Dynamic Adjustment of StopLoss and TakeProfit Levels

The `AdjustLevels()` function is called by the `OnTick()` function to perform dynamic adjustment of StopLoss and TakeProfit levels. This function should be implemented based on the specific logic and requirements of the trading strategy.

### User Configuration of Settings for Dynamic Adjustments

The `ConfigureSettings()` function allows users to configure settings for dynamic adjustments. This function should provide a user-friendly interface for adjusting parameters such as the risk level, target profit, etc.

### Support for Market Orders for the Nasdaq 100

The `OpenMarketOrder()` function is responsible for placing a market order for the Nasdaq 100. It should implement the necessary logic to determine the appropriate order size and direction based on the trading strategy.

### Support for Pending Orders for the Nasdaq 100

The `OpenPendingOrder()` function is responsible for placing a pending order for the Nasdaq 100. It should implement the necessary logic to determine the appropriate order size, direction, and entry price based on the trading strategy.
